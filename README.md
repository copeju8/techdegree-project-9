
##REST API Project - Goal "Exceeds Expectations"

For this project, I created a REST API using Express. The API provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database. Users are required to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```

Second, seed the SQLite database.

```
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```
npm start
```

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
